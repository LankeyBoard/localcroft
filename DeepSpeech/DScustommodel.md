### Things have changed!

Things have changed a good deal since it was written, and the .7 version has much different setup as well.
The Deepspeech docs have gotten quite good since this was originally written, and I recommend you go here:
https://deepspeech.readthedocs.io/en/v0.7.1/TRAINING.html?highlight=fine-tune#continuing-training-from-a-release-model
and follow those steps!
